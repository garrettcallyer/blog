Github [Repo](https://github.com/garrettcallyer/csci340lab7) for application

What were the easiest parts of the tutorial? \n

Most of the tutorial was easy just due to the easy layout of it and the large amount of details, but specifically the copying of the code and creating of folders in the first few steps was simple and straight forward.

What were confusing parts of the tutorial? \n

The application of both Github and the use of the Core Web application together and getting those to interact with each other correctly was difficult to repeat on my device at first, but Dr. Goadrich was helpful.

What was difficult to translate when creating your own application in Step 2? \n

The Github and repo creation and adding the website to the repo was difficult to translate and it was a little challenging to update and change the fields in the correct spot to make a new database with new items to enter into the website.

What parallels and differences do you see between the Jekyll framework and the Razor framework? \n

They are very similar in how they create a standard template to then go in and change which is super helpful in getting started, but the Razor framework has far more intricate pieces and parts that can go wrong when  testing and making a website in this way. Just a lot more options with Razor Pages, which is nice but can get confusing

How confident do you feel making another Razor application? \n

Somewhat confident, will probably need a tutorials help at least to get started but shouldn't be too difficult to at least get started, I assume it will get more complex when we add more datatypes and multiple tables interacting with each other with queries.
