What parts were new to you? <br>
A few parts that were new to me included:
- adding images to a webpage using markdown
- creating a new sub directory for the [CSCI webpage](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/)
- locating minima using command line
- changing layouts using minima and command line

What parts did you struggle with? <br>
I struggled with adding images at first because I didn't know which directory to put images in and how to link them. Also, I didn't know how to copy and locate files, so I had to use some trial and error when attempting to use the ["bundle info --path minima"](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/) command.

What parts still do not make sense? <br>
I still can't figure out how to use the local repo to make changes instead of using the commits through Github and having to wait a few minutes to view changes on the public site. I'll be meeting with Dr. Goadrich to discuss this further.

What are you looking forward to? <br>
Changing up this blog and making it my own with a lot of cool stylings, themes, and new posts.
