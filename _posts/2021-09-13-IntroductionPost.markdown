What parts were new to you?
A few parts that were new to me included:
- using markdown code in my HTML website
- navigating the command line to install Jekyll
- running new commands I haven't used from the command line

What parts did you struggle with?
I struggled with adding a text document with the necessary source and description details to download a few necessary applications. Dr. Goadrich was able to help me work through my [issues](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/issue).

What parts still do not make sense?
Everything makes sense now with the help of Dr. Goadrich and a couple classmates as well as [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) markdown guide.

What are you looking forward to?
Starting to figure out how to use markdown and get use to running this blog and making new posts for our final project.

Your post must include at least two links and a list.
