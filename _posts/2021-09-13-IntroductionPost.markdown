What parts were new to you? <br>
A few parts that were new to me included:
- using markdown code in my HTML website
- navigating the command line to install Jekyll
- running new commands I haven't used from the command line

What parts did you struggle with? <br>
I struggled with adding a text document with the necessary source and description details to download a few necessary applications. Dr. Goadrich was able to help me work through my [issues](https://www.thesaurus.com/browse/issue).

What parts still do not make sense? <br>
Everything makes sense now with the help of Dr. Goadrich and a couple classmates as well as [this](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) markdown guide.

What are you looking forward to? <br>
Starting to figure out how to use markdown and get use to running this blog and making new posts for our final project.
