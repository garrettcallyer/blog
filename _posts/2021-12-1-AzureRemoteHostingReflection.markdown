What were the easiest parts of the tutorial? <br>

The easiest parts of the tutorial were the beginning steps to make the project as well as some of the Azure to Git steps. Given that our group did not really finish this lab, most of it was difficult. Not really anyone faults, just was a hard a challenging assignment especially working in a group on the same tutorial.

What were confusing parts of the tutorial? <br>

Everything else was pretty challenging. The most confusing part was the firewall access probably. It was hard to track the location aspect, that threw people off, and my group and I were confused on those parts. I think part of the confusion came when we were working with multiple people and not being able to do other parts of the tutorial until other pieces were done. I was unaware a lot of the time where the group was in terms of step within the tutorial and part of me wondered whether this would be easier as an individual assignment, similar to past labs. The database creation specifically was also challenging as Azure is a little hard to use at first especially with the Azure Command Line rather than the normal command line I was used to up to this point. Again, no ones fault, just a lot of things that didn't go our way and got worse as the lab went on.

How did your team divide up the work? What communication skills did you build coordinating with your team on a common code base for this lab? <br>

I think some of this brought me back to sharing a computer screen in 150 and some of 151. This was not literal of course, but everything was very dependent upon the previous steps so working in groups was a challenge, but we were able to manage. We divided up the lab into the 3 parts/sections in the tutorial. I think the best communication skills I learned working as one team on a lab had to be not talking over one another and explaining my ideas thoroughly. Getting everyone on the same page was a big help for our group I think even though we didn't make it all the way through this lab.
