My role on the team has remained similar to how it began. I am primarily working on the backend trying to get the parsing of the CSV files to work properly as well as take this parsed data and add it to the database. This has been the most challenging part of the Final Project so far given I have not had much experience working with Razor Pages and this new tool CSVHelper that is embed in razor pages as a downloadable add-on to parse and get records from CSV files. <br>

I did not take part in much of the creation of the presentation, but I did do my best to talk and explain some of the harder to explain pieces of the project including the pieces mentioned above in regards to the CSV files. I feel like I played a vital role in trying to explain some of those backend pieces when questions came up on the topic.<br>

In the future, I plan to continue to work on the back end and also step over to wherever I am needed. I am beginning to worry how far we can get in terms of our Final Project given where we are at currently and the work that still needs to be done. However, I will continue to put my best foot forward and work until we have a great product for our client, Professor Yorgey.
