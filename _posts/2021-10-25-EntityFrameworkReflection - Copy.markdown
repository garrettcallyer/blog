What were the easiest parts of the tutorial? <br>

The easiest parts of the tutorial came at the beginning when we were doing similar things to lab 7 working with a single table.

What were confusing parts of the tutorial? <br>

The hardest and most confusing part was all the different moving parts to create a multilayered dataset on a web page.
Also, once we had to add parameters of our own in step 2, I got a little confused at first, but was able to rectify that and work through my issues by slowing down and looking back in the tutorial at each individual piece that was needed.

What was difficult about working with multiple tables as opposed to the single table in the previous lab? <br>

Many different classes for each entity was the most challenging piece, as well as updating each individual piece for the INSERT, DELETE, INDEX, etc. classes. I had a tough time keeping up with the multiple scaffolding items and different folders for each entity as well, but I assume that I will improve by continuing to work in Visual Studios and with Razor Pages tutorials and classes/files.

How prepared do you feel to create your team project now for your client, and what will be different for your situation? <br>

This lab was very related to many of the things we want to do with Professor Yorgey. She wants a nice way to format a table to submit to the IRS and be able to change different aspects of what she uploads from her different tax sites. I am glad we worked through this lab, I feel like we can apply 75% or more of this lab to our final project.
