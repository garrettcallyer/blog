What skills and talents are most valuable in carrying out the social change work you are doing with your community partner? <br>

The most valuable skills used during this social change experience included clear communication with community partner, constant contact/updates to community partner, relatability between tech and non-tech fields, and clear understanding of the end goal from the community partner.

How well do those skills mesh with the talents or limitations you have come to see in yourself through the experience?<br>

The talents I possess fall close in line with a good portion of the skills needed for this project. I believe part of this has to do with the people I associate myself with outside the classroom and the wide variety of people I consider my friends and family. I see much of the dismay that technology can bring to other people. I think I can provide a bridge to alleviate some of the stress and confusion. I am not as great at communicating with people I have never met or barely know. I wouldn't say I am very outgoing, but more opportunities like this with community partners should help that.

Consider the social, environmental, or spiritual need on which you are focusing for this Odyssey project. Do you feel that the approaches to creating social change employed by your community partner are effective ways of creating change in this area? Why or why not?<br>

I believe Professor Yorgey and her mission to give more people the opportunity to fill out their taxes is very helpful. I think an underrated part of her organization is the volunteer opportunities to learn more about the tax system and help others in the process. Economic struggles will always be impactful to everyone in the world today and Professor Yorgey's actions are alleviating some of that pressure and making life easier for middle and lower class individuals.

Have any of your fundamental values, social ideals, or significant beliefs been challenged or confirmed through this experience?<br>

I have more belief in using technology to solve more real world related issues and help people do things that they may have seen as impossible or very challenging. I have a stronger desire to looking closer to home and try to help my community also after working through this project. I think I can create some real change through computer science and technology at a place a lot closer to myself than I first realized.

Have you found any of your academic coursework helpful in understanding what you have observed and experienced?<br>

I have found some help in this course and in Data Structures specifically. I see those two classes as stepping stones to becoming a great programmer and computer scientist in any career field. Between knowing which data structures to use where and understanding the backend of databases and web development, I think these courses will be the ones I look back on as game changers for me when I enter the career field and start pursuing work as a Software Developer, Architect, or something else.

Anything you learned in class that you would directly challenge now that you have had this experience?<br>

Just the realm of possibilities within my hometown and the boundaries I feel like I can push to create real societal change have changed for me. I think there is a lot more we can do close to home and not have to travel to these bigger, busier cities to find a worthwhile successful career that mounts change for others. I'm glad I have this experience to look to and say I made something that is new and original and necessary for people and it not be some needless project that I forget about soon after the class finishes.

There are many social, political, environmental, or community issues on which you might work in the years ahead. How has this experience reshaped your views on the public issues that call you to action?<br>

I am more focused on the middle and lower classes than I have been before and just the availability, or lack there of, of money. What can I make or design that can help lower class people pay for food, water, housing and clothes. I really feel like there is something to be had here for the people of my community who are struggling financially and I want to help them using technology. I feel called to make lives easier through computer science and this class and experience has opened my eyes to some of those opportunities.
