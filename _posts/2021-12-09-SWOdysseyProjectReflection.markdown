Personal role in your team project so far <br>

I am primarily working with the database and schema using the SQLite and querying we have learned to better equip myself for the final.

Contribution to the second client meeting <br>

I discussed with Professor Yorgey her impressions of the schema and what she wanted to be able to query and change in the tables to then be able to export. I also helped to explain the moqup and what we imagine her UI to look like to see if she had the same ideas or different ones. I also messaged Professor Yorgey primarily to help get the meeting set up.

Future plans to assist your team in completing this project <br>

I am planning to get more and more familiar with the Razor Pages and Entity Relationships over the many different classes and folders to have the best possible understanding of what is to come for this final project. I want to be as prepared as possible for the many differing tables and overall database we are trying to implement and do m best to understand and fix any bugs that occur with the help of my team members.
